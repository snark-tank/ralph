## OHM / Olympus DAO

**Date Researched:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Evolved (Still Active but 97%+ down from ATH)

### Overview

Olympus DAO launched in March 2021 as a "decentralized reserve currency protocol" that aimed to create a free-floating reserve currency backed by a basket of assets. The protocol introduced revolutionary concepts like Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) and the famous (3,3) game theory meme. At its peak, OHM reached $3,209 with a $4.4B market cap, becoming the standard-bearer of "DeFi 2.0".

### Key Mechanics

1. **(3,3) Game Theory**
   - Two players, three actions: Stake, Bond, Sell
   - Scoring: Stake = +3 for both (cooperative), Sell = -3 (competitive loss)
   - Stake+Stake = (3,3) = Maximum benefit for all
   - Sell+Sell = (-3,-3) = Worst outcome for everyone
   - Created powerful social pressure to stake rather than sell

2. **Bonding Mechanism**
   - Users provide LP tokens or assets (DAI, ETH, FRAX) to buy OHM at a discount
   - 5-day vesting period prevents immediate dumping
   - Treasury acquires liquidity and reserve assets
   - Generates profit for treasury to back OHM value

3. **Staking & Rebasing**
   - Stakers lock OHM, receive sOHM (staked OHM)
   - sOHM rebases automatically every epoch (~8 hours)
   - APY was as high as 7,000%+ at peak
   - New OHM minted from treasury profits distributed to stakers

4. **Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)**
   - Olympus owns its own liquidity (not rented from LPs)
   - LP tokens retained permanently in treasury
   - Ensures constant liquidity and stable pricing
   - Revolutionary concept adopted by many protocols

5. **Range Bound Stability (RBS)**
   - Automatic price stabilization via market operations
   - Buy/burn OHM when price too low
   - Mint/sell OHM when price too high
   - Dutch auctions within price cushions

### What Worked

- **POL Innovation**: Protocol-owned liquidity became industry standard, solving mercenary capital problem
- **Treasury Building**: Successfully accumulated $600M+ treasury at peak
- **Community Engagement**: (3,3) meme created cult-like loyalty and FOMO
- **DeFi 2.0 Movement**: Sparked entire category of protocols using similar mechanics
- **Cross-chain Expansion**: Successfully bridged to multiple chains including Solana (2025)
- **Sustained Development**: Still actively developing and iterating years later

### What Failed

- **Unsustainable APY**: 7,000% APY requires infinite growth - classic Ponzi structure
- **Death Spiral Risk**: When confidence breaks, stake→sell cascade crashes price
- **Whale Dumping**: DAO leader "shotta" sold $11M causing 40% crash in 2 hours
- **pOHM Controversy**: Private investors got non-diluting tokens (11.8% of rebases forever)
- **Price-Treasury Disconnect**: Token price traded at massive premium to backing
- **Paper Gains Illusion**: "You can only be rich on paper" - eventually people sell
- **Fork Mania**: Dozens of copycats diluted attention and failed spectacularly (Wonderland, etc.)
- **97% Drawdown**: From $3,209 ATH to under $100

### Lessons for $FED

**DO Adopt:**
- ✅ Protocol-owned liquidity concept - $FED already does this via LP fees
- ✅ Game theory framing - holding = good for everyone, selling = bad
- ✅ Treasury accumulation - build reserves from trading fees
- ✅ Staking tiers/multipliers for loyalty (without rebasing)

**DON'T Adopt:**
- ❌ High APY rebasing - unsustainable and attracts mercenary capital
- ❌ Bonding discounts - creates selling pressure when bonds vest
- ❌ Complex token economics that confuse users
- ❌ Private token allocations with special privileges

**Key Insight for $FED:**
The core $FED model is BETTER than OHM because:
1. Rewards come from REAL trading fees, not token inflation
2. USD1 distribution doesn't dilute $FED supply
3. No need for complex bonding/rebasing mechanics
4. Sustainable as long as trading volume exists
