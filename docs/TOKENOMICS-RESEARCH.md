## Research Log

### 2026-01-21: Initial Research Summary

**Key Insight from Today's Performance:**
- 14x pump in 24 hours demonstrates strong market interest
- Consistent distributions ($39K total) builds trust
- Real-time fee sharing creates "every holder gets paid" narrative

**What's Working:**
1. **Immediate Distribution** - Holders see USD1 hitting wallets in real-time during pumps
2. **Tier System** - Chairman (10M+) → Cabinet → Senator → Representative → Citizen creates aspirational holding targets
3. **Transparency** - All distributions on-chain, verifiable

**Areas to Monitor:**
1. SOL for gas - Need to maintain operational funds
2. New holder onboarding - Some fail to receive distributions due to missing token accounts
3. Distribution frequency during high volume periods

## Tokenomics Comparisons

### GMX (GLP Fee Sharing)
- Real yield from trading fees
- 70% of fees to stakers
- Successful model: $600M+ TVL at peak
- **Lesson:** Real yield attracts sticky capital

### OHM (Olympus DAO)
- (3,3) game theory
- High APY through dilution
- Failed long-term: death spiral
- **Lesson:** Real yield > ponzi tokenomics

### BANANA (ApeSwap)
- Fee sharing with buyback burns
- Sustainable but boring
- **Lesson:** Need engagement hooks beyond raw yield

### CAKE (PancakeSwap)
- Burn mechanics
- Lottery/NFT engagement
- **Lesson:** Gamification drives engagement

---

## Potential Improvements (RESEARCH ONLY)

These are ideas for future research - NOT immediate implementation:

### 1. Dynamic Distribution Frequency
- During pumps (>10% 1h): More frequent distributions
- During dumps: Buyback focus
- Quiet periods: Standard daily distribution
- **Why:** Reward holders when things are exciting

### 2. Holder Milestone NFTs
- First distribution received
- 10 consecutive distributions (Diamond Hands)
- Top 100 holder achievement
- **Why:** Social proof, flex material

### 3. Distribution Notification System
- Push notifications when distributions hit
- Leaderboard updates
- **Why:** Engagement and retention

### 4. Auto-ATA Creation Fund
- Pre-fund token account creation for new holders
- Removes friction from receiving first distribution
- **Why:** Today's failure showed this friction point

## 2026-01-22: Deep Dive - Pendle sPENDLE & GMX Fee Distribution Models

### Pendle Finance Analysis

**Protocol Size:** $3.5B TVL (13th largest DeFi protocol)
**2025 Revenue:** $37M+ in fee generation

#### vePENDLE to sPENDLE Transition (January 2026)

Pendle just made a major governance shift that's highly relevant to FED:

**The Problem They Solved:**
- vePENDLE required multi-year locks (up to 2 years)
- Complex voting mechanics meant rewards concentrated among sophisticated users
- Long lock-ups became "significant barriers" for most users
- Only a tiny fraction of users captured the benefits despite protocol growth

**sPENDLE Solution:**
- Liquid staking token with 14-day withdrawal (or instant with 5% fee)
- Up to 80% of protocol revenue used for PENDLE buybacks
- Buyback tokens distributed as governance rewards
- Algorithmic emission model reduces overall emissions by ~30%

**Key Insight for FED:**
Pendle learned that complexity kills adoption. Despite generating $37M in fees, most users couldn't navigate the system. Their solution: simplify access while maintaining value accrual through buybacks.

**FED Application:**
- FED's "just hold = earn" model is CORRECT - simplicity wins
- Our buyback mechanism mirrors Pendle's new approach
- We should NOT add complex staking/locking (validates our rejection)
- Consider: Could we allocate higher % of fees to buyback during dips?

### GMX Fee Distribution Analysis

**Protocol Size:** Major perp DEX on Arbitrum/Avalanche/Solana
**Model:** Real yield from trading fees (not inflation)

#### GMX V1 (GLP) Model:
- Multi-asset liquidity pool (30% stables, 25% ETH, 25% BTC, 20% alts)
- **70% of fees** → GLP holders (liquidity providers)
- **30% of fees** → GMX stakers
- Fees paid in ETH/AVAX (real yield, not token emissions)

#### GMX V2 Evolution (GLV):
- Isolated GM liquidity pools with GLV vaults on top
- Dynamic rebalancing toward best-performing pools
- **Auto-compounding** with 20-30% historical annualized performance
- Significant UX improvement over V1

#### 2025-2026 Updates:
- Discussion of $200K/month USDC buybacks (Jan-March 2026)
- Proposal to reallocate 27% of protocol revenue to growth initiatives
- Expanded to Solana (GMX-Solana) in March 2025
- GMX Multichain via LayerZero (Base network, Sept 2025)

**Key Insight for FED:**
GMX proves real yield works at scale. Their 70/30 split (LPs/stakers) creates aligned incentives. The evolution to auto-compounding GLV shows the market wants passive, optimized returns.

**FED Application:**
- Our 100% distribution to holders model is simpler than GMX (good for memecoin)
- Consider: Should we reserve any % for protocol treasury/growth?
- Auto-compounding concept could apply to FED (compound distributions back to more $FED)
- GMX buyback discussions validate our buyback strategy

### Distribution Frequency Research

**Industry Standards:**

| Protocol | Distribution Frequency | Model |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Ethereum | Every ~6.4 minutes (epoch) | Block rewards |
| GMX | Continuous (per-tx fees) | Real-time accrual |
| Pendle | Per-trade + epoch | Hybrid |
| Most DeFi | Weekly/Monthly | Batched |
| **FED** | **Every ~2 minutes** | Real-time distribution |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Weekly/Monthly is standard** - Reduces gas costs, admin overhead
2. **Real-time is rare** - FED's 2-min frequency is UNUSUAL (differentiator!)
3. **Ethereum epochs** - 6.4 minutes is the fastest common standard
4. **Trade-off:** Frequent = better UX but higher gas costs

**FED's Competitive Advantage:**
Our 2-minute distribution is a major differentiator. Most DeFi makes you wait days/weeks. We deliver yield in near real-time. This creates:
- Immediate gratification (dopamine on distribution)
- "Always earning" psychology
- Strong differentiation from weekly/monthly protocols

**Recommendation:**
KEEP the ~2 minute frequency. It's a feature, not a bug. The gas cost is worth the UX and differentiation.

**Potential Optimization (QE4):**
- Dynamic batching: More recipients per tx during low-value periods
- Priority during pumps: Increase frequency to every 1 minute during high volume
- Consolidate during quiet: Batch larger during low activity periods

## Key Research Conclusions (Jan 22, 2026)

### What FED Is Doing Right:

1. **Simplicity** - "Just hold = earn" is validated by Pendle's pivot away from complex locking
2. **Real Yield** - No inflation, real fee distribution (GMX model proven at scale)
3. **Frequent Distribution** - 2-min cadence is a differentiator, not a problem
4. **Buyback Mechanism** - Mirrors what Pendle just adopted (80% revenue to buybacks)

### What to Consider for QE4:

1. **Dynamic Distribution Timing** - Volume-based frequency adjustment
2. **Buyback Ratio Tuning** - Current threshold-based; consider % allocation approach
3. **Auto-Compound Option** - Let holders opt-in to compound distributions back to $FED
4. **Gas Optimization** - Better batching during quiet periods

### What NOT to Do:

1. **Don't add locking** - Pendle just removed it, proving complexity hurts adoption
2. **Don't reduce frequency** - 2-min distribution is our moat
3. **Don't complicate multipliers** - Current tier system is intuitive
4. **Don't add multiple tokens** - One token, one purpose (remains correct)
