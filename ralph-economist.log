## Research Iteration Summary - Jan 22, 2026

### Current FED State
- **$51,603** distributed across **374 distributions**
- ~1,800+ holders with tier multipliers up to 4.5x
- Distribution frequency: ~2 minutes

### Research Conducted

**1. Pendle Finance (sPENDLE Transition)**
- $3.5B TVL protocol just removed complex vePENDLE locking
- New sPENDLE: liquid staking with 14-day withdrawal
- 80% of revenue now goes to buybacks → distributed as rewards
- **Key insight:** Complexity hurts adoption. Our "just hold = earn" model is validated.

**2. GMX Fee Distribution**
- Real yield model: 70% to LPs, 30% to stakers
- Evolution to GLV with auto-compounding (20-30% APY boost)
- Recent discussions: $200K/month buybacks for trader incentives
- **Key insight:** Auto-compounding is in demand. Market wants passive optimization.

**3. Distribution Frequency Analysis**
- Industry standard: Weekly/monthly distributions
- Ethereum epochs: ~6.4 minutes
- FED's 2-minute frequency is a **key differentiator**
- **Recommendation:** Keep current frequency. It's our competitive moat.

### Documentation Updated

1. **TOKENOMICS-RESEARCH.md** - Added deep dive on Pendle sPENDLE transition, GMX model, and distribution frequency research with sources and FED applications.

2. **ROADMAP.md** - Updated research dependencies (dynamic frequency: COMPLETE), added auto-compound as new QE4 consideration, added Pendle validation note to rejected ideas.

3. **PROPOSALS.md** - New draft proposal: **Optional Auto-Compound to $FED** - allows holders to opt-in to automatically convert USD1 distributions back to $FED tokens.

### Key Conclusions

**What FED is doing right:**
- Simplicity ("just hold = earn") - validated by Pendle's reversal
- Real yield distribution - proven at scale by GMX
- 2-minute frequency - rare differentiator in the market
- Buyback mechanism - mirrors Pendle's new 80% revenue approach

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't add locking/staking requirements
- Don't reduce distribution frequency
- Don't add multiple tokens

**New proposal for consideration:**
- Auto-compound option (opt-in only, preserves simplicity)

Research iteration complete. Here's a summary:

## Ralph Economist Iteration Complete

### Updates Made:

**README.md (Public Repo Face)**
- Updated Total Distributed: $38,564 → **$51,683**
- Marked QE2 as **ACHIEVED** (was showing as "next target")
- Updated to QE3 progress: **51.7%** ($51,683 / $100,000)
- Fixed distribution count: **378 distributions**

**TOKENOMICS-RESEARCH.md**
- Added comprehensive **Holder Retention Tactics Deep Dive**
- Documented industry retention stats (63% DeFi repeat rate)
- Analyzed diamond hands psychology and what creates long-term holders
- Case studies: BONK (airdrops + burns), PEPE (community), WIF (organic), GMX (real yield)
- Ranked retention factors by FED relevance
- Clear recommendations for QE3/QE4

**ROADMAP.md**
- Added QE3 goal: Activate engagement systems
- Marked quest/seasonal/referral systems as BUILT (need activation)
- Added holder retention research to completed status
- Added scaling research as NEXT PRIORITY
- Updated research findings summary with retention insights

### Key Research Conclusions:

1. **FED's approach is validated** - Real yield beats inflation, simplicity beats complexity
2. **Gap is engagement, not mechanics** - Systems are built but need activation and visibility
3. **Missing piece: Leaderboards/social proof** - Research shows this drives retention
4. **2-min distribution is our moat** - Keep it, don't reduce
5. **Next research needed:** Scaling to 10K+ holders (gas optimization)

2026-01-22 06:51 UTC - Ralph Economist research iteration complete

## Research Focus
Scaling challenges at 10K+ holders (gas optimization, batching strategies)

## Key Findings

### Distribution Models Analyzed:
1. Push-based (FED current) - Works to ~10K holders with optimization
2. Claim-based (Merkle) - NOT recommended, breaks our UX
3. ZK Compression - Solution for 10K+ holders (2,500x cost reduction)
4. Hybrid - Possible intermediate solution

### Solana Constraints:
- 1,232 byte transaction limit
- ~5 transfers per batch transaction (practical)
- Current cost: ~0.005 SOL per distribution cycle

### Scaling Path:
- QE3 (1,800 holders): Current model works fine
- QE4 (5K-10K): Optimize batching, smart timing
- QE5 (10K-50K): Migrate to ZK Compression (Helius AirShip)
- QE6+ (50K+): Full ZK or accrual model

### Solana Upgrades Helping Us:
- Firedancer (Q2 2026): 1.2M TPS
- Alpenglow (Q1 2026): Sub-150ms finality

## Files Updated:
- README.md: Stats updated (1,735 distributed, 380 runs)
- TOKENOMICS-RESEARCH.md: Full scaling research added
- ROADMAP.md: QE4/QE5 scaling sections updated

## Next Research Topic:
Auto-compound economics modeling
